->First of all we have to set the debconf frontend to non-interactive as it is recommended in case of shell scripts 
	echo 'debconf debconf/frontend select Noninteractive' | sudo debconf-set-selections
	sudo apt-get install -y -q

	1. Debconf is a configuration system for debian packages, provides interface for packages configuration and dialog is the default frontend for apt package manager in debian 
	Issue- as we were running these commands in script so it is advised to set frontend to non-interactive

->There is an additional configuration which can be added at the time of tasksel not located as apt-get update sometimes is not completely processed so we add a sleep statement , normally     	sleep 30

->Used tasksel which reduced the problem of specifying versions for php, apache and mysql and also installed the extensions needed for setting up drupal
	sudo tasksel install lamp-server
	sudo apt install php-dom php-gd php-xml -

->The if statement which is taking the input environment variable as a decisive parameter to whether install drupal or wordpress.
	if [ $input == "drupal" ]

#If drupal is chosen to be installed

->This if statement is if mysql/ database is already configured in the instance, then no need to create a database
	if [ -f /etc/init.d/mysql* ]
        then
                echo "Already installed"
        else
                sudo mysql -u root -padmin -e "CREATE DATABASE drupal CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;"
                sudo mysql -u root -padmin -e "GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON drupal.* TO ‘drupaluser’@’localhost’ IDENTIFIED 		BY 'root';"
        fi

->Download the tar file and then installing it 
	D9="drupal-9.1.6"
        wget https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/$D9.tar.gz
        tar -zxf $D9.tar.gz

#Rest is the configuration statements involved in the installation of drupal

->Create a Root directory:
	mkdir /var/www/html/drupal

->Move Drupal files to localhost:
	cp -R drupal-8.6.2/* drupal-8.6.2/.htaccess /var/www/html/drupal

->Create directory for Drupal:
	mkdir /var/www/html/drupal/sites/default/files

->Change permission of the new directories so that Drupal can access them:
	sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/drupal/sites/default/files

->Create a Drupal configuration file:
	sudo cp /var/www/html/drupal/sites/default/default.settings.php /var/www/html/drupal/sites/default/settings.php

->Change access authorization of the Drupal configuration file:
	sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/drupal/sites/default/settings.php

->Restart Apache with:
	service apache2 restart

->Enable Clean URLs on Apache: To avoid warnings when installing Drupal, it is preferable to enable these before.
	sudo sed -i '172s/.*/        AllowOverride All/' /etc/apache2/apache2.conf


#If wordpress is chosen to be installed
#Same procedure as of drupal

if [ -f /etc/init.d/mysql* ]
        then
                echo "Already installed"
